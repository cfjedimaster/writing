# Using on-device AI to Enhance Webflow CMS Content

Most people's interactions with AI are via (hopefully) helpful bots and tools like ChatGPT. AI can be used nearly everywhere to (again, hopefully) enhance and expand the experience. One of the new frontiers for AI is directly in the web browser itself, thanks to efforts by the Google Chrome team. Chrome's [built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai) feature aims to bring the power of a large language model directly to the user's browser itself. Of course, this is in a somewhat smaller form, using the Gemini Nano model, but it still brings quite a bit of power to web developers. Even better, it can run completely offline, and basically for free. No API keys are required! 

This feature is still in early days and changing rapidly, but broadly, the Chrome team supports task focused APIs as well as a general purpose prompting API. Current features include:

* Both language detection and translation
* Writing and Rewriting text for tone and length
* Summarization of content
* Proofreading content
* And of course, a general purpose prompt.
